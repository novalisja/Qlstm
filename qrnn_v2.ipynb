    "In this demo we recreate the architecture proposed in Learning to learn with quantum neural networks via classical neural networks 1, using PennyLane and TensorFlow. We use classical recurrent neural networks to assist the optimization of variational quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a brief theoretical overview explaining the problem and the setup used to solve it. After that, we deep dive into the code to build a fully functioning model, ready to be further developed or customized for your own needs. Without further ado, let’s begin!\n",

    "# Problem: Optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms\n",
    "Recently, a big effort by the quantum computing community has been devoted to the study of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) which leverage quantum circuits with fixed shape and tunable parameters. The idea is similar to classical neural networks, where the weights of the network are optimized during training. Similarly, once the shape of the variational quantum circuit is chosen — something that is very difficult and sensitive to the particular task at hand — its tunable parameters are optimized iteratively by minimizing a cost (or loss) function, which measures how good the quantum algorithm is performing (see 2 for a thorough overview on VQAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A major challenge for VQAs relates to the optimization of tunable parameters, which was shown to be a very hard task 3, 2 . Parameter initialization plays a key role in this scenario, since initializing the parameters in the proximity of an optimal solution leads to faster convergence and better results. Thus, a good initialization strategy is crucial to promote the convergence of local optimizers to local extrema and to select reasonably good local minima. By local optimizer, we mean a procedure that moves from one solution to another by small (local) changes in parameter space. These are opposed to global search methods, which take into account large sections of parameter space to propose a new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such strategy could come from the classical machine learning literature.\n",

    "That’s remarkable! The RNN learned to propose new parameters such that the MaxCut cost is minimized very rapidly: in just a few iterations the loss reaches a minimum. Actually, it takes just a single step for the LSTM to find a very good minimum. In fact, due to the recurrent loop, the loss in each time step is directly dependent on the previous ones, with the first iteration thus having a lot of influence on the loss function defined above. Changing the loss function, for example giving less importance to initial steps and just focusing on the last one, leads to different optimization behaviors, but with the same final results."

    "As is clear from the picture, the RNN reaches a better minimum in fewer iterations than the standard SGD. Thus, as the authors suggest, the trained RNN can be used for a few iterations at the start of the training procedure to initialize the parameters of the quantum circuit close to an optimal solution. Then, a standard optimizer like the SGD can be used to fine-tune the proposed parameters and reach even better solutions. While on this small scale example the benefits of using an LSTM to initialize parameters may seem modest, on more complicated instances and problems it can make a big difference, since, on random initialization of the parameters, standard local optimizer may encounter problems finding a good minimization direction (for further details, see 1, 2).\n",
